# Step 7: Private Access to Azure PaaS Services

## Overview:
Used Azure Private Link to connect to Azure PaaS services securely, ensuring that the traffic remains private within the Azure VNet.

### Steps:
1. **Configure Private Link**:
   - Created a private endpoint for Azure SQL Database and linked it to the Database Subnet.
2. **Verify Connectivity**:
   - I confirmed that the database could be accessed via the private link without exposing it to the public internet.
