# Deployment Steps for CloudSecureNet

Follow these instructions to deploy the hybrid cloud networking project.

### 1. Azure Virtual Network Setup:
- Create a VNet in your preferred Azure region.
- Subdivide the VNet into subnets (WebApp Subnet, Database Subnet, Admin Subnet).

### 2. Simulate On-Premises Environment:
- Provision a second VNet to simulate the on-premises environment. This can be in the same or different region.

### 3. Secure Connectivity:
- Set up an Azure VPN Gateway to establish a site-to-site connection between the simulated on-premises VNet and the main Azure VNet.
- Test connectivity by pinging resources between VNets.

### 4. Resource Deployment:
- Deploy virtual machines (VMs) in each subnet (e.g., web server in WebApp Subnet, database in Database Subnet).
- Secure these VMs using Network Security Groups (NSGs).

### 5. Private Access to Azure PaaS:
- Set up Azure Private Link for services like Azure SQL Database to ensure they are accessed via private endpoints.

### 6. DNS and Load Balancer:
- Configure custom DNS settings using Azure DNS.
- Deploy Azure Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across your VMs in the WebApp Subnet.

### 7. Monitoring and Security:
- Enable monitoring on NSGs and VPN Gateway.
- Set up Azure Monitor alerts for any unusual traffic or connectivity issues.

### Troubleshooting:
- Common issues with VPN configuration can be diagnosed using Azure diagnostics and traffic logs.
