# Step 9: Performance and Security Testing

## Overview:
I simulated network traffic scenarios to validate performance and security.

### Steps:
1. **Simulate Data Transition**:
   - Tested data transfer between the simulated on-premises network and the Azure environment.
2. **Security Testing**:
   - Attempted unauthorized access to validate NSG rules and VPN security.
